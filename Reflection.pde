Part A - (5/5)
-----------------------------
Comments - 1/1 (for // line 5, 10, 22 | Multilines examples can be seen on lines 1, 26/27)
Indentation/formatting - 1/1 (I autoformatted my coding once completed)
Naming - 1/1 (lines 12, 17 & 183)
Readme - 1/1 (Included everthing in rubric marking)
Reflection - 1/1 (See summary below)

Having completed all the work for Comments, Indentation/formatting, Naming, ReadMe and Reflection as described in the detailed in rubric I will give myself a good mark. 
Part A Mark: (5/5)

Part B - (2/2)
-----------------------------
I have sized the display window correctly – 1/1 (line number 5)
I have positioned the display window correctly 1/1 (line number 6)
Part B Mark: (5/5)

Part C - (5/5)
-----------------------------
setup() and draw()

I have setup() added from lines 3 - 7. 
I have draw() added from lines 9 - 20.
The coding I have added to setup() and draw() is working for this reason I am going to give myself an excellent score here. 
Part C Mark: 5/5

Part D: (6/10)
-----------------------------
If statements

I have a nested if statement at lines 142 – 146.
I have another nested if which combines 2 if statements using a logical operator at lines 168 – 173.
I believe I need more if statements to get an excellent or very good. Due to the complexity of my if statements I am going to give myself a good.
Part D Mark: 6/10

Part E: (12/20)
-----------------------------
Loops

I have x2 while loops on line 62-68 and 89-95.
I have x2 for loops on lines 73-76 and 79-84.
I have a nested for loop on lines 24-33.

For having a nested for loop as well as x2 while and for loop I am giving myself just over a good mark.
Part E Mark: (12/20)

Part F: (14/20)
-----------------------------
Bespoke Method * show line numbers for the method definitions, AND the method calls

I will give you x2 examples of Bespoke methods that take parameters:
1. Method called on line 12. Method defination on line 36.
2. Method called on line 16. Method defination on line 98.

I will give x2 examples of of bespoke methods with no paramemters:
1. Method called on line 17. Method defination on line 140.
2. Method called on line 19. Method defination on line 189.

As shown I have used 3+ bespoke methods. However none give a return value and for the this I give myself a very good mark.
Part F Mark: (14/20)

Part G: (10/10)
-----------------------------
Processing Method calls – (nothing for setup() and draw(), nothing for mouse methods, or
string methods)

strokeWeight() - line 30
fill() - line 31
rect() - line 32
ellipse() - line 150
textAlign() - 191
textSize() - 192
text() - 195

I have shown 7 processing methods with line numbers alos given. I am giving a excellent mark for this.
Part G Mark: (10/10)

Part H: (4/10)
-----------------------------
Mouse Methods

I have 1 mouse method in my piece on line 179. For this I will give myself a pass.
Part H Mark: (4/10)

Part I: (0/10)
-----------------------------
String Methods (i.e. methods called from the Java String class)

I did use int length on line 36. Incorrectly so to labelled as a String so I will have to give myself a fail here.
Part I Mark: (0/10)

Part J: (3/3)
-----------------------------
My program saves the display in a PNG file on a mouse dragged (3/3)
Part J Mark: (3/3)

Part K: (2/5)
-----------------------------
My display has a grid theme but also has shapes overlaying each other, some that change color. I believe it is easy on the eye and while not perferct it has enough for a pass.
Part K Mark: (2/5)
